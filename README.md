# radi-ot (Radio + Godot) 📻

**radi-ot** is a feature-packed 3D audio streaming addon for **Godot 4.8** that streams real live Seattle radio stations over the internet. Built for both **Steam (Forward+)** and **Web (Compatibility)**, it features positional 3D audio, an in-game retro-modern CanvasLayer HUD, procedural FM tuning static, and an `urgent_bulletin()` API designed for in-game narrative progression and emergency broadcasts.

## ✨ Features

- **3D Positional Spatial Audio:** `RadiOtPlayer3D` extends `AudioStreamPlayer3D`, offering realistic distance attenuation, unit size, and panning attached to any in-game object (vehicles, radios, boomboxes, storefronts).
- **Curated Seattle Radio Presets (.tres):**
  - **88.5 FM — KNKX:** Jazz, Blues, and NPR News
  - **89.5 FM — C89.5 (KNHC):** Student-run Electronic, Dance, and House
  - **90.3 FM — KEXP:** World-renowned Independent, Alternative, and Eclectic
  - **91.3 FM — KBCS:** Community radio and diverse global sounds
  - **94.9 FM — KUOW:** Puget Sound NPR News and Information
  - **98.1 FM — KING-FM:** Classical Seattle
- **Urgent Bulletin System (`urgent_bulletin`):** Seamlessly interrupt live radio broadcasts with custom story audio (emergency broadcasts, story alerts, news flashes). When the bulletin finishes, live radio automatically resumes.
- **Retro-Modern CanvasLayer HUD:** Displays current frequency, call sign, genre, live signal indicator, animated dial bar, keyboard hints, and emergency alert banners.
- **Procedural FM Static:** Realistic white/pink noise static plays seamlessly while buffering or switching between stations.
- **Dual-Platform Streaming Engine:**
  - **Steam / Desktop (Forward+):** High-performance chunk-buffered HTTP client with automatic redirect handling (HTTP 301/302/307), MP3 frame-sync alignment, and persistent stream connection management.
  - **Web (HTML5 / Compatibility):** Native Web Audio API / HTML5 Audio integration with 3D camera-listener distance attenuation and volume tracking.
- **Interactive Demo Keyboard Controls:**
  - `[L]` — Tune to Next Station
  - `[J]` — Tune to Previous Station
  - `[M]` — Toggle Radio Power On/Off

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Add to Your Scene
Add a `RadiOtPlayer3D` node to your 3D world, or instantiate the ready-to-use scene:
```text
res://addons/radi_ot/scenes/radi_ot_player_3d.tscn
```

### 2. Configure & Tune
- Select the `RadiOtPlayer3D` node in the Scene tree.
- In the Inspector, verify that `station_collection` is set to `seattle_stations_default.tres` (or assign your own custom collection).
- Run the scene (`F5` or `F6`).
- Call `tune_next_station()` to go to the Next Station
  - The demo uses the [J] key to tune next station.
- Call `tune_previous_station()` to go to the Previous Station
  - The demo uses the [L] key to tune previous station.
- Call `toggle_power()` to turn the radio on or off
  - The demo uses the [M] key to toggle power.

## 🎮 Narrative Story Bulletins (`urgent_bulletin`)

Trigger emergency announcements, breaking news alerts, or story events that temporarily override the live stream:

```gdscript
extends Node3D

@onready var radio: RadiOtPlayer3D = $RadiOtPlayer3D

func trigger_emergency_story_event() -> void:
    var news_audio: AudioStream = preload("res://assets/audio/alien_invasion_news.ogg")
    
    radio.urgent_bulletin(
        news_audio,
        "EMERGENCY BROADCAST: Unidentified objects spotted over Elliott Bay and the Space Needle!",
        15.0 # Optional duration override in seconds
    )
```

You can also cancel an active bulletin early:
```gdscript
radio.cancel_bulletin()
```

## 📻 Custom Stations & Collections (`.tres`)

### Creating a New Station
Create a new `RadioStation` resource (`.tres`) in the Godot inspector:

```text
station_name: "Space Needle Beats"
call_sign: "KSEA"
frequency: 101.5
stream_url: "http://stream.example.com/live.mp3"
genre: "Synthwave / Cyberpunk"
tagline: "Soundtrack of the Emerald City"
description: "Late-night synthwave broadcast from atop the Space Needle."
```

### Station Collections
Group your stations into a `RadioStationCollection` resource (`.tres`) and assign it to the `station_collection` property of `RadiOtPlayer3D`.
